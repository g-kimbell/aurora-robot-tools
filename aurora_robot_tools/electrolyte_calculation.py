Determine the electrolyte mixing steps required.

The script reads the electrolytes required and their volumes from the Cell_Assembly_Table in the
chemspeedDB database. It then reads the mixing ratios from the Electrolyte_Table and calculates all
the of the mixing steps (such as move 100 uL from vial 1 to vial 5, etc.) required to prepare all
electrolytes for the cells.

Usage:
    The script is called from electrolyte_calculation.exe by the AutoSuite software.
    It can also be called from the command line.
